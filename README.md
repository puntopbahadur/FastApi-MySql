Project Description:
-----------------------
This is a small API testing project that performs CRUD operations using FastAPI as the backend API. Playwright (Python) is used to automate and validate these operations through API test scripts. All the data interactions are connected to a MySQL database, where each operation (Create, Read, Update, Delete) is verified for correctness.

Technologies Used:
--------------------------
1. FastAPI for building RESTful APIs
2. Playwright (Python) for automated API testing
3. MySQL is the backend database
4. SQLModel for ORM (Object Relational Mapping)

Installation dependencies
---------------------------
1. pip install fastapi 
2. pip install uvicorn
3. pip install pydantic
4. python -m pip install mysql-connector-python
5. pip install sqlmodel
